## üìû Project Inspiration

**Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF)** signaling was first developed by **Bell Laboratories** in the early 1960s to facilitate automated telephone switching systems. This technology enabled telephones to transmit digits using a combination of two tones‚Äîone low frequency and one high frequency‚Äîfor each key pressed.

While DTMF was originally intended to route calls through exchanges, this project reimagines it in a modern setting. Here, we use DTMF to **detect a single dialed number** via a microphone in MATLAB. The goal is to decode the tone by identifying the two frequency components that define the digit, bringing classical communication technology into the digital signal processing domain.

## üßÆ Mathematical Basis: FFT to Goertzel Algorithm

To analyze which number was dialed, we need to extract the frequency content of the recorded signal. Typically, this is done using the **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)** or its fast implementation, the **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**.

However, for DTMF, we only care about **eight specific frequencies**. Calculating the entire FFT spectrum is inefficient. The **Goertzel algorithm** provides a more computationally efficient alternative‚Äîit calculates the DFT at specific frequencies using a recursive method.

The final DFT magnitude is derived from the last two outputs of this recursive filter. The beauty of this method is that it **isolates and amplifies** just one frequency bin, making it ideal for applications like tone detection.

## üîä DTMF: Superposition of Two Sine Waves

According to the recommendations of the International Telephone and Telegraph Consultative Committee (CCITT), Internationally, DTMF signals are generated by superimposing and combining one frequency from the low-frequency group (679 Hz, 770 Hz, 852 Hz, 941 Hz) and the high-frequency group (1209 Hz, 1336 Hz, 1477 Hz, 1633 Hz).
Sixteen combinations can be generated to represent different numbers and functional characters.
- **Low group:** 697 Hz, 770 Hz, 852 Hz, 941 Hz
- **High group:** 1209 Hz, 1336 Hz, 1477 Hz, 1633 Hz

For example:
- Pressing the key **'5'** produces a tone containing both **770 Hz and 1336 Hz**.

These tones are recorded via microphone and analyzed in MATLAB. The Goertzel algorithm calculates the signal's DFT magnitudes at the eight DTMF frequencies. The **two frequencies with the highest magnitudes** are matched against a standard DTMF keypad matrix:
